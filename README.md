# Players_System
This is a Next.js project built with MongoDB and Mongoose to manage players data. It provides a simple RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting player records. The project also demonstrates the usage of Next.js App Router with dynamic API routes, server-side database connections, and modern React/Next.js patterns.
